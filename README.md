# Multi View Geometry
Open source Multiview Geometry library in C++ for autonomous driving platform and autonomous robots 

## What is this?

- This library implements the traditional Computer Vision algorithms for machine vision.
- Used in autonomous driving platform or autonomous robots including autonomous drones, rovers and submarines.

## Why another platform?

- To support a non-vendor dependent implemenation, so there is no dependency in any major companies like NVIDA, Intel, AMD, and others.

## What's the implementation roadmap?

   The plan is to implement:
   
- Epipolar Geometry constraint, Multiview Geometry
- Namely,
- Essential Matrix Estimation
- Foundamental Matrix Estimation
- Pairwise Matching
- Direct Linear Transform (8 point algorithm)
- Nonlinear and linear optimizations
- GBA (Generic Bundle Adjustment)
- Feature Extractions
- Differentiation
- Gradient Descent
- Structure from Motion
- Sparse 3D reconstruction
- Dense 3D reconstruction

## What's the vision?

- To provide the baseline implmenation of noble neural network architecture for autonomous robots including self-driving platform.
- Towards creation of noble neural network architure to support multi-modality.
